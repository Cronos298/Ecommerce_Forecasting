# E-commerce Sales Forecasting Dashboard

## Overview
This project builds an end-to-end solution to predict future e-commerce sales and visualize the results in an interactive dashboard. It includes:
- An ETL pipeline to extract, transform, and load data.
- A forecasting model using Prophet to predict sales.
- A Streamlit dashboard to display historical and forecasted sales.

## How to Run
1. Install Python** and set up a virtual environment.
2. Install required packages: pandas numpy matplotlib plotly streamlit prophet scikit-learn
3. Run the ETL pipeline
4. Run the Forecasting model
5. Launch the Dashboard

## Project Structure
- `ecommerce_data.csv` - The raw sales data.
- `clean_ecommerce_data.csv` - The cleaned data after the ETL process.
- `etl_pipeline.py` - Code for data extraction, transformation, and loading.
- `forecasting.py` - Code for training the forecasting model and plotting predictions.
- `dashboard.py` - Code for creating an interactive dashboard.
